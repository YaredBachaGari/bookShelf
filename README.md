<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The Book Shelf App is a React-based web application designed to help users keep track of their reading list. The app provides an intuitive user interface that enables users to organize books into three categories: "Read," "Currently Reading," and "Want to Read." Additionally, users can search for books by title or author and add them to their reading list with ease.

The Book Shelf App was developed as part of the Udacity React Nanodegree program, which required the use of Udacity's API for fetching book data. As a result, the app is built to meet the specific requirements outlined by the program's instructors.

The Book Shelf App is a valuable tool for avid readers who want to keep their reading list organized and easily accessible. With its simple and user-friendly interface, users can easily add new books to their list, track their progress, and keep their reading goals in sight. Overall, the Book Shelf App is a practical and efficient solution for anyone looking to streamline their reading list management.
